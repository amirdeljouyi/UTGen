The com.lts.cmdline package treats command line parameters like system properties.
Switches like "quiet" or "verbose" are transformed into a name/value pair 
that is set to "true" or "false" depending on the meaning of the switch.  
Value-oriented options like "class path" or "output directory" become properties
whose value is either defined (i.e., it was provided on the command line) or 
null (i.e., not on the command line).

<P>
Parameters that are not introduced by a switch can be identified by the order 
that they appear in.  They can also result in a "list" of properties.

<A name="command_line_processor">
<H3>CommandLineProcessor</H3>
</A>

The first class of interest for this package is the CommandLineProcessor class.
This class defines one method, processCommandLine, that in turn maps the command
line into properties.

<A name="creating">
<H3>BasicCommandLineProcessor</H3>
</A>

This class uses a number of conventions in its approach to processing command 
lines.  Specifically:

<P>
<UL>
<LI>options have a "short form" that is introduced introduced with the "-"
character.
<LI>options have a "long form" that is introduced with two "-" characters.
<LI>options may "consume" more than one element from the command line.
</UL>

<P>
The "short form" is the classic command line switch.  For example, "ls -l" 
displays directory details in Unix.  The "-l" in this situation is a switch.

<P>
Short options can be chained together.  For example: "ls -lt" sets the "l" 
option and the "t" option.  It is equivalent to "ls -l -t".

<P>
The "long form" uses "--" to introduce the option.  For example: "--help".

<P>
The long form is also the method for specifying arguments to the command.  For 
example: "ls foo" passes the string "foo" as an argument to the ls command.

Classes that extend com.lts.application.Application have the built-in capability 
to process command lines.  This is performed when the startApplication(String[] argv) 
method is called.  That method calls getCommandLineProcessor, and then calls 
processCommandLine on the returned object.

<A name="specification">
<H3>String Specifications</H3>
</A>

This package comes with the <A href="FormalParameterFactory.html">
FormalParameterFactory</A> class that is typically used to create the formal 
parameters for a program.  The class takes a two dimensional string array and 
creates instances of FormalParameter from each "row."

<P>
Such specifications have the following form:

<P>
<CODE>
<PRE>
public static final String[][] spec = {
	{ <I>name</I>, <I>mandatory</I>, <I>type</I>, <I>short</I>, <I>long</I>[, <I>position</I>] },
	...
};
</PRE>
</CODE>

<P>
"type" is the style of parameter being created.  Options are "switch", 
"argument" and "required-argument".  switch formals set the corresponding property
to true or false based on the presence of the switch on the command line.  If the
switch is present, the value is set to true, otherwise it is set to false.

<P>
Type "optional" indicates an optional argument.  "required" means that the formal
must be supplied.

<P>
"name" is the name of the property to be set if the formal parameter matches.

<P>
"short" is the single character short form for the parameter.  For example 
the "-l" in the command "ls -l" would have a value of "l" for this field.

<P>
Argument formal parameters can use null as the value for short, which means that 
the argument is never introduced with a switch.

<P>
"long" is string that the parameter must match if it is passed as "--<I>option</I>"
For example, if the command accepts "--help" then this field would be the 
string "help".

<P>
Argument formal parameters can use null as the value for long.  Doing so indicates
that the formal is never introduced with a "--" style option.

<P>
If this field is not supplied at all, it means that the formal never accepts 
arguments.  Supplying a value of null or the string "none" has the same effect.
A value of "required" means that an argument <I>must</I> be supplied or the 
formal will generate an exception.  A value of "optional" means that the formal
can accept a parameter if one is supplied.

<P>
If a value of "optional" or "required" is supplied for the argument field, 
a value for the "position" field may also be specified.  The position field
means that an argument is accepted once and only once for the formal parameter,
and then only at the location indicated.

<P>
For example, suppose that you are specifying a new command command that compares
the contents of two files.  Here are the details of the command line:

<P>
<UL>
<LI>file1 --- one of the files to compare.
<LI>file2 --- the other file to use in the compare.
<LI>-q, --quiet --- quiet mode.
<LI>-d &lt;directory&gt;, --base-dir &lt;directory&gt; --- the base directory that 
the file names are relative to.
</UL>


The command requires two arguments that are the files
to be compared.  The files are referred to as "file1" and "file2."  The command 
can also operate in "quiet" mode, where it signals the results through a return
code.  Quiet can be specified via the "-q" option or by "--quiet".

<P>
Here is a specification that defines this command:

<P>
<CODE>
<PRE>
public static final String[][] spec = {
        { "file1",   "required", null, null, "1" },
        { "file2",   "required", null, null, "2" },
        { "quiet",   "switch",   "q",  "quiet" },
        { "baseDir", "optional", "d",  "base-directory" },
        
        { "argument", "file1", null, null, "required", "1" },
        { "argument", "file2", null, null, "required", "2" },
        { "switch", "quiet", "q", "quiet" },
        { "argument", "baseDir", "d", "base-directory", "required" },
};
</PRE>
</CODE>
