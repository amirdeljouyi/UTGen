<H1>The Forward and Listen Pattern</H1>
Rather than modifying application data directly, the UI works with a virtual object that 
presents the same interface that the underlying data would and forwards requests onto 
the underlying data.  The UI then listens for changes just at it would if some other 
agent were instigating the change instead of itself.
 
<H2>Motivation</H2>
While in theory the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern should allow the application data
(the model) and the representation of that data (the view) to be independent, in practice
Java does not allow this to be the case.  The Forward and Listen (FAL) pattern makes this
more of a reality.

<H3>The Missing Control Component</H3>
If there are two views of the model (the application data), MVC assumes that both are
notified of a change to that data.  Unfortunately, Java provides no such mechanism for
lists of data.  


<P>
This pattern provides an approach to supply the need to keep the model and the view in
sync through an interface called NotifyList and it's associated classes.
</P>

<H2>What FAL Provides</H2>
The FAL pattern consists of the following basic classes:

<UL>
	<LI>NotifyingList - a list that tells subscribers about creates, updates and
	deletes.</LI>

	<LI>ListEvent - an event from a NotifyingList.</LI>
	<LI>NotifyingListListener - an objects capable of receiving ListEvents.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
FAL also supplies the following derived and support classes:
</P>

<UL>
	<LI></LI>
	<LI>ListProxy - a NotifyingList that forwards requests for basic CRUD operations onto
	another NotifyingList.</LI>

	<LI>NotifyingListHelper - a class that can manage notifications for a
	NotifyingList.</LI>

	<LI>SublistProxy - a ListProxy that incorporates that filters some of the underlying
	elements.</LI>

	<LI>SublistInclusionTest - an interface that defines the include method used with
	SublistProxy.</LI>

	<LI>TableListBridge - a RowModelTableAdaptor that translates events from a
	NotifyingList to TableModelEvents.</LI>

	<LI>SortedListProxy - a ListProxy that sorts its members without changing the
	underlying ordering.
</UL>

<P>
While the actual classes and interfaces are not always that complex, they can be combined
to form very complex and useful structures.  For example, suppose you have a list of
events.  Suppose further that you want to display only some of them and in an order other
than that they occurred.  This can be accomplished by using SublistProxy to filter only
those events that occurr in a particular time range, and SortedListProxy to then sort the
remaining elements.  
</P>

<P>
As it turns out, this is much simpler than trying to implement both filtering and sorting
in one class.  Add to that the problems with converting a list into a TableModel, and the
power of this framework becomes clearer.

<P>
When creating a UI, the Model-View-Controller (MVC) approach is often times used.  What 
happens if the Model is not shared by several views?  The idea behind MVC is that this can 
be done, but in practice this introduces an application dependency between the UI and the 
application data when using typed languages like Java.
</P>

<P>
For example, given the classes:
</P>

<P>
<CODE>
<PRE>
	class ModelDataPerson
	{
		public String getName();
		public String getSSN();
		public int getAge();
	}
	
	public class ApplicationData
	{
		public List getPersons();
	}
</PRE>
</CODE>
</P>

<P>
How is the UI to deal with a List?  Lists do not notify objects when they change.  Furthermore,
they are not inherently synchronized.
</P>

<P>
One solution is to use a system of classes and interfaces like the following:
</P>

<P>
<CODE>
<PRE>
	public interface ListListener
	{
		public void listEvent(ListEvent event);
	}
	
	public class ListEvent
	{
		public enum ListEvents
		{
			insert,
			update,
			delete,
			allChanged
		}
		
		public int index;
		public ListEvents event;
	}
	
	public interface ListEventSource
	{
		public void addListener (ListListener listener);
		public void removeListener (ListListener listener);
	}
	
	public interface NotifyingList extends List implements ListEventSource
	{}
</PRE>
</CODE>
</P>
