A framework for simplifying GUI applications.

<H2>Introduction</H2>
The application framework simplifies writing programs by providing the following
services:

<UL>
	<LI><A href="#quickstart">Quick Start</A>
	<LI><A href="#application_properties">Application Properties Management</A>
	<LI><A href="#command_line">Command Line Processing</A>
	<LI><A href="#repositories">Data Management</A>
	<LI><A href="#startup_shutdown">Startup and Shutdown Procedures</A>
</UL>

<H2> <A name="quickstart"> Quick Start </A> </H2>

The com.lts.application framework provides a variety of utility classes for
developing a "standard" application.  To use the framework, the developer must
define:

<UL>
	<LI><A href="#quick_subclass">Subclass BasicApplication</A>
	<LI><A href="#quick_properties">System Properties</A>
	<LI><A href="#quick_command_line">Command Line Arguments</A>
	<LI><A href="#quick_recovery">Crash Recovery</A>
	<LI><A href="#quick_repository">Application Data</A>
</UL>

<H3> <A name="quick_subclass">Subclass BasicApplication</A> </H3>

BasicApplication defines default implementations for all the methods that are
required of an application that uses this framework.  Said methods are declared
in the com.lts.app.Application class.

<P>
This new class must define two methods: main and startApplication.  Here is an
example using the application class name: MyApp:

<CODE>
<PRE>
public static void main (String[] args)
{
	Application app = new MyApp();
	app.startApplication(args);
}

public void startApplication ()
{
	// perform whatever application functions we would normally perform
}
</PRE>
</CODE>

<P>
The rest of this discussion details what other default methods need to be
overridden.


<H3> <A name="quick_properties">System Properties</A> </H3>
To define properties for your application, do the following:

<P>
<UL>
<LI><A href="DefaultApplicationProperties.html">Subclass DefaultApplicationProperties</A>
<LI>
	<A href="BasicApplication.html#newApplicationProperties">
		Override BasicApplication.newApplicationProperties
	</A>
</UL>

This section refers properties that a) apply to different sessions, projects,
etc. and b) cannot easily be represented with name=value style properties.  An
example might be the coding style that the user can define for Eclipse: it
applies to the projects developed with Eclipse and is fairly complex.

<P>
By default, the application framework provides name=value style properties as a
properties file that is stored in the user's "home" directory.  

The default implementation defines the following system properties:

<UL>
	<LI>Last application file opened
	<LI>Last directory visited when opening or saving a file
</UL>

<P>
If your application needs more properties than this, then you should create a
subclass of the DefaultApplicationProperties class that defines the names,
default values, etc. for your application.  You also need to override the
BasicApplication.newApplicationProperties method to return an instance of
your properties class.

<P>
The previous discussion also assumes that your application's properties can be
defined with simply name = value style properties.  If you need to store more
complex data, then you should also subclass the DefaultApplicationProperties
class so that it "knows" how to load and store the application data.  You will
also need to override BasicApplication.newApplicationRepository to return an
instance of this class.

<P> <B>NOTE</B> <BR/>

Application properties data is different from what people would consider
application data.  For example, a word document is what this framework considers
"session data," while things like whether to perform spell checking, what should
appear on the toolbars, etc. is what this framework considers to be "application
properties."

<P>
Some aspects of this distinction are:

<UL>
	<LI>Application properties apply to all documents, sessions, etc.
	<LI>Session data contains useful data to a user, application properties
	generally do not.
</UL>

<P>
The distinction is not always clear-cut.

<H3> <A name="quick_command_line">command line arguments</A> </H3>

If your application is going to do any command line processing then you will
need to do the following:

<UL>
	<LI>Subclass DefaultCommandLinePolicy
	<LI>Override BasicApplication.getCommandLinePolicy
</UL>

<P>
The subclass of DefaultCommandLinePolicy should define what the switches, etc.
are for the application, what property names they map to, etc.

<P>
See DefaultCommandLinePolicy for a discussion of what the default properties
are.  Briefly, one argument tells the application which application properties
file to use, another tells the application what session data file to use.

<H3> <A name="quick_recovery">Crash Recovery</A> </H3>

If you want your application to be able to recover from crashes, then you will
need to do the following:

<UL>
	<LI>Use and existing subclass or define a subclass of RecoveryPolicy
	<LI>Override BasicApplication.getRecoveryPolicy
</UL>

<P>
By default, BasicApplication performs no recovery.  If the system crashes in the
middle of a user's session, the user loses all their data.  At startup, the
system does not try to find recovery files.

<P>
BasicRecoveryPolicy periodically tells the application to "checkpoint" its data.
On startup, BRP will look for checkpoints and alert the user or application
regarding the possibility that the system crashed needs to be undergo recovery.

<P>
You can tune BasicRecoveryPolicy with parameters such as how frequently
checkpoints should be created, whether they should only include session data or
application properties as well, etc.  You can also define your own subclass of
RecoveryPolicy if you wish.

<H3> <A name="quick_repository">Datafiles</A> </H3>

If you want it to, the framework can group similar files together into
repositories.  The advantage is that the entire group of files can be backed up
or restored, instead of having to perform the same operation on each file in the
group.  In addition, the notions of repositories is central to being able to
utilize the framework's crash recovery capability.

<P>
The simplest way to use this functionality is to subclass the ZipFileRepository
class.  Define methods to load and store the data for your application.  This
may simply be calling "loadObject" and "storeObject" for the various classes
that your application deals with.

<P>
For more information, see the section on repositories in this document and the
javadoc for the ApplicationRepository class.

<H3> <A name="quick_properties">System Properties</A> </H3>








<H3>
	<A name="application_properties">
		Application Properties Management
	</A>
</H3>
A useful capability for an application is to "remember" aspects of the user's
last session such as what file they last worked on, what their preferences for
the application are, etc.  While these are useful to have, they can be annoying
to program.  

<P>
The application framework simplifies this problem by doing the following:

<UL>
	<LI>Providing an API to get, set, save and load properties
	<LI>Automatically loading properties at startup
	<LI>Automatically saving properties at shutdown
</UL>


<H3><A name="repositories">Data Management</A></H3>

The application framework makes use of a pattern called repositories.  A
repository is essentially a collection of files that are subject to operations
that act on the entire group.  These operations are:

<UL>
	<LI>create - create a new repository
	<LI>open - open an existing repository
	<LI>commit - save the current state of the repository
	<LI>rollback - cancel any changes made to the repository
	<LI>checkpoint - protect against a system crash
	<LI>delete - remove an existing repository and all files contained therein
</UL>

<P>
A repository is typically implemented as a ZIP file or a directory.  The name
of a repository becomes the name of the file where the data is stored.

<H3>
	<A name="command_line">
		Command Line Processing
	</A>
</H3>

The framework provides a simple way of defining and processing command line
arguments.  The developer defines the various arguments and switches, and how
they map to values.  The application then parses the command line and sets the
system properties according to what was provided on the command line.


<H3>
	<A name="startup_shutdown">
		Startup and Shutdown Procedures
	</A>
</H3>

The framework defines a sequences of steps that it goes through when starting up
or shutting down.  See the Application class for details but a good example
would be:

<UL>
	<LI>Process the command line
	<LI>Clean up any temporary files
	<LI>If a checkpoint exists, notify the user
	<LI>If a previous session exists, try to load that
	<LI>Create an empty session and start the application
</UL>
