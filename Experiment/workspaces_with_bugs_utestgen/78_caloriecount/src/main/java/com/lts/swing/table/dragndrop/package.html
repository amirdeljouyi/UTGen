This package implements "drag and drop" moves in JTables.  That is, using select, 
drag, and release, the user can move around rows in the same table.  This is a 
very limited subset of the full drag and drop implementation: you cannot copy,
paste, etc.

The following sequence of method calls seem to be made against the JTable's 
TransferHandler.  I don't understand everything that is going on here, so some of 
the method calls seem to occur for no reason:

<UL>
<LI>getSourceActions</LI>
<LI>exportAsDrag</LI>
<LI>getSourceActions</LI>
<LI>createTransferable</LI>
<LI>canImport</LI>

<LI>When the drop gesture occurs, importData is called</LI>
<LI>exportDone</LI>
</UL>

<H3>getSourceActions</H3>
Before doing anything else, this method is called <I>twice</I>.  No idea why its twice 
instead of once, but I guess that's why I don't get paid the big bucks...

<H3>exportAsDrag</H3>
This method call would make sense if it were not for the fact that the method is not 
allowed to return anything.  In drag and drop land, this is a sort of "get ready to
export" method.  Rather odd.

<H3>getSourceActions</H3>
This just makes no sense to me.  Do they expect the available operations to change 
after making the call to exportData?  Who knows.

<H3>createTransferable</H3>
This call makes a sort of sense, but why use exportAsDrag and then createTransferable?
Why not just make one call that exports the data and creates a transferable?  Whatever. 

<H3>canImport</H3>
The idea here is to figure out if the destination component can accept the data being 
dragged.  It seems that every time the mouse moves, this method is called again, which 
makes sense since the mouse may be over a different component.

<H3>importData</H3>
Once the "drag gesture" is made, this method is called.  In Windows, this is releasing 
the left button.  It is important to do the move here because at this point, the 
selected row for the JTable is set to the destination.  Before and after this, it 
is set to the last row in the selection.

<H3>exportDone</H3>
The idea is that, if this were a drop from one component to another, this would be 
the time to remove the data from the source.

This class was created to simply implementing the special case that this package 
addresses: moving rows via drag and drop.  Subclasses need only implement the following
methods:

<UL>
<LI>retrieveAndRemoveRow - get a row of data to be moved.</LI>
<LI>insertRow - put a row of data</LI>
</UL>
