<H2>Calorie Count</H2>
An application to keep track of how much you eat.

<P>
A basic tool for controlling weight is keeping a food log --- when you eat and 
how many calories you eat.  Calorie Count is designed to help you do this by automating
the tracking process.
</P>

<P>
Periodically, CC will ask you if you have had something to eat.  If you have simply
select the food that you ate and calorie count will record it.  CC also keeps 
track of how many calories you have consumed during the day and how many you have
"banked."
</P>

<P>
The idea is that you have so many calories you can consume during the day, and therefore
some number per hour, etc.  After a period of time, you will have "earned" some number
of calories and can therefore eat something without guilt.  CC also tells you when to 
try and "be strong" by telling you if you are over your budget.
