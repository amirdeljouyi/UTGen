<H2>Introduction</H2>
<H3>Java Serialization</H3>
Java serialization implicitly assumes that the data will be stored in a single, binary
file stream.  This approach is fine for many applications, but is generally very 
difficult if you want to be able to read the serialized state of the object during 
debugging.  

<P>
Furthermore, if you want to partition an object up into multiple files so that, for 
example, you can skip aspects of the object that no longer apply since the last 
serialization, instances do not have to know about the pervious makeup of the class
unless there is a name conflict.
</P>

<H3>Virtual File System</H3>
The com.lts.application (CLA) framework uses a virtual system of directories rather
than a binary output stream.  This allows classes much more flexibility in deciding 
how they will be stored.  For example:

<UL>
<LI>A class can simply use the default serialization mechanism.</LI>
<LI>A class could opt to store each field as a separate file.</LI>
<LI>A class can store its state using XML</LI>
</UL>

<P>
This generally results in a much easier to debug system as the contents 
of the repository are much more human-friendly than what you would expect from
the default mechanism.
</P>

<H2>The CLA Architecture</H2>
The two basic interfaces/classes in CLA serialization are ApplicationData and
ApplicationRepository.  ApplicationRepository presents an abstract file system 
(system of directories) where data can be stored.  

<P>
Application data can be stored as an actual system of directories or as a single
ZIP file simply by changing the implementor of ApplicationRepository.  The 
Repository class also handles the mechnics of load/store/commit/rollback for the 
application for multiple virtual files.
</P>

<P>
The ApplicationData class is concerned with how the state of the data is represented
in a virtual file system.  This class might decide, for example, to divide the state
of the object between two virtual files.  This class also decides how to handle 
the situation where the underlying representation has changed in a manner that not 
all of the object's state is initialized by deserialization.
