<H2>Command Line Properties</H2>
In the context of com.lts.application, command line arguments are processed by 
setting properties that the rest of the application can obtain the value of by 
simply using getProperty.  

<P>
This package supports the following types of properties:
<UL>
<LI>boolean
<LI>string
<LI>parameter
</UL>

<H3>boolean</H3>
The BooleanProperty class is used for processesing these types of parameters.

<P>
Such parameters function as true/false style switches: they are on or off.  For
example, a switch that tells a program to be "verbose" or not could have the 
form:

<CODE>
<PRE>
foo -v
</PRE>
</CODE>

<P>
Would indicate verbose mode.  The absence of the parameter would indicate non-verbose 
mode.  

<P>
These parameters are accessed via a property name that has a string value of 
"true" or "false".  One value is the default value that is set if the parameter 
is absent from the command line.  The other value is used when the property is 
present on the command line.

<P>
Boolean, switch-style properties can be set in one of two ways: using a short 
form, like the "-v" option shown above, or a "long form" where the switch is 
introduced via the "--" sequence.  For example: "--verbose".

<P>
When using the short form, several switches can be set at once.  For example,

<CODE>
<PRE>
foo -xv
</PRE>
</CODE>

<P>
Sets the x and v switches at the same time.  When using the long form, only one 
switch can be set at a time.

<H3>String Properties</H3>
These properties use the class StringProperty to contain their information.

<P>
These parameters are 

<P>
For example, some compilers allow you to specify the name of an output file 
on the command line via a sequence like "-o &lt;output file&gt;"

<H3>parameter</H3>
Command line options that do not use any kind of "introduction" For example,

<CODE>
<PRE>
javac one.java two.java
</PRE>
</CODE>

Considers "one.java" and "two.java" to be parameters.
